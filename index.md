## Welcome to Front in BH

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/frontinbh/frontinbh/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/frontinbh/frontinbh/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
